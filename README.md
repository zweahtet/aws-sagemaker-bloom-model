### This repo is for testing AWS SageMaker and HuggingFace models

#### Before running the code, you will need an AWS account and set up SageMaker.

Sagemaker allows live collaboration but since we don't know how to add people on AWS, you can clone this repo to your SageMaker and test the code. Please read this documentation on how to clone [cloning a repo to sagemaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-tasks-git.html)
